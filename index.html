                    <p>Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
                        A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application,
                        allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.</p>

                    <p>
                        Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features
                        such as thorough dependency injection,
                        an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration
                        testing, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you are new to PHP or web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework
                        that can grow with you.
                        We'll help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your
                        expertise to the next level.
                        We can't wait to see what you build.

                        There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application.
                        However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.

                    <h6>A Progressive Framework</h6>
                    <p>
                        We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework.
                        By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you.
                        If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Laravel's vast library of
                        documentation, guides, and <a href="https://laracasts.com/">video tutorials</a> will help you
                        learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for <a

                        Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications and ready to handle enterprise
                        work loads.

                    <h6>A Scalable Framework</h6>
                    <p>
                        Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's
                        built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel
                        is a breeze.
                        In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests
                        per month.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Need extreme scaling? Platforms like Laravel Vapor allow you to run your Laravel application at
                        nearly limitless scale on AWS's latest serverless technology.
                    </p>
                    <h6>A Community Framework</h6>
                    <p>
                        Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer
                        friendly framework available.
                        In addition, thousands of talented developers from around the world have contributed to the
                        framework.
                        Who knows, maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.

                            Almost every modern web application interacts with a database.
                            Laravel makes interacting with databases extremely simple across a variety of supported
                            databases using raw SQL, a fluent query builder, and the Eloquent ORM.
                            Currently, Laravel provides first-party support for four databases:
                        </p>
                        <ul>

                            type, Free type<br>
                            Products can be added to any video. The products on the website will be displayed below the
                            video player<br>
                            The same concept has been applied in the Play List only that here there is a series of
                            videos which have the next preview buttons to see this group of videos.

                            A permission is the right to access one or more system objects. A role is a group of
                            permissions. Roles can be assigned to any user or user group, and a user or user group can
                            have more than one role. Unlike hierarchical users, a role does not contain another role.

                        <h2>ADS (Pre-Roll, Mid-Roll)</h2>
                        <p>Ads inserted into videos are classified into Pre-Roll, Mid-Roll, Post-Roll ads based on their
                            position or placement in the video i.e., before, in the middle, or after the video completes
                            playback.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pre-roll</strong> ad is an ad that is played before the video starts to play – which
                            is why it has
                            the word “pre” in its name. When you click on a video that you want to watch, and if that
                            video has a pre-roll ad associated with it, then the player will first play the pre-roll ad
                            and then begin to display the video that you requested.
                            Pre-roll ads are a great way of monetizing VOD content and commonly used by AVOD services.
                            There are a few distinct advantages to using pre-roll ads.<br>
                            The user has explicitly requested the video and is interested in watching it. So, the
                            likelihood of the user watching the ad is quite high, and his chances of abandoning the
                            video simply because it contains an ad is low.<br>
                            Ad fatigue probably hasn’t set in, and an AVOD service provider can get away with a couple
                            of pre-roll ads right at the start of the video – especially if the video is popular and
                            in-demand.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Mid-roll</strong> ads are those ads that are played by interrupting the video
                            playback. The video is
                            paused, the mid-roll ad is played, and after the mid-roll ad is completed or skipped, the
                            video playback is resumed.
                            All of us have experienced mid-roll ads while watching videos on YouTube or on AVOD-based
                            streaming services. There are several points to be taken into consideration for mid-roll ads
                            –<br>
                            Placement – where do you place the mid-roll ads and how far apart? If you place several
                            mid-roll ads close to each other, then the user is bound to get annoyed.<br>
                            Frequency – how many mid-roll ads are you going to insert into the video? If your video is
                            10 mins long and you insert two 30-second ads every one minute, then your user is probably
                            going to flee! On the other hand, if you insert only two ads in a 10 min long video, is that
                            going to help or hurt your bottom-line? There is a fine line between making income and
                            annoying your users.<br>
                            However, mid-roll ads are considered to be high-converting ad units with pretty high
                            completion rates. I guess that comes down to the fact that users might watch or skip over
                            your ad unit while watching a movie, but, they are unlikely to abandon the movie simply
                            because of an ad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ads can be added to the Advertisment module.
                            The ads will appear on the single page or after the videos you want to display
                            Pre-roll and Mid-roll can be added to a video in the dashboard editing option.

                        <p>When it comes to running a successful online store there’s a lot to keep track of. From
                            high-level metrics like revenue or number of orders, down to more detailed information such
                            as customer feedback, there simply isn’t one ecommerce analytics tool that covers it
                            all.<br>
                            So as a business owner, how can you oversee all the different parts of your online store
                            without wasting minutes or even hours every time you need to look up some important data?
                        </p>
                        <p>Dashboards differ from more specialised ecommerce analytics tools and reports, in that their
                            purpose is to surface just the most important information viewers might care about, rather
                            than every possible metric that can be sliced and diced in an infinite number of ways.</p>

                        <p>Dashboards don’t just help with monitoring your operations in real time though. Another
                            important use for them is as a powerful team motivation tool.</p>

                        <h2>Orders</h2>
                        <p>Order management is the order-to-cash sales process that sits at the heart of any goods-based
                            B2C and B2B company. Put simply, it’s the end-to-end cycle of receiving and processing a
                            customer order through to fulfillment. Order management is not conducted in isolation; it
                            relies upon almost every department in a company: from a customer service team to the
                            warehouse staff, the accounting department through to delivery partners. When mastered
                            effectively, order management ensures a business’s workflow runs smoothly by establishing
                            efficient processes to keep it moving forward; maintaining customer satisfaction and
                            protecting a company’s reputation.</p>
                        <p>Most ecommerce brands are unable to grow without an order management system in place.
                            Customers expect efficient, cost-effective, and personalized order fulfillment.
                            There is no room for manual error.
                            Employees should be focused on optimizing the brand experience, not triaging backorder SKUs,
                            calling carriers, or printing documentation.</p>

                        <h2>Email module</h2>

                        <p>Sending email doesn't have to be complicated.
                            Laravel provides a clean, simple email API powered by the popular SwiftMailer library.
                            Laravel and SwiftMailer provide drivers for sending email via SMTP, Mailgun, Postmark,
                            Amazon SES, and sendmail, allowing you to quickly get started sending mail through a local
                            or cloud based service of your choice.
                            Laravel's email services may be configured via your application's config/mail.php
                            configuration file.
                        </p>
                        <p>VideoFx has mail system in Forget Password, Subscribe system, Add new Video if you are
                            Subscribe</p>

                        <h4>Configure Laravel Mail</h4>
                        <p>Laravel uses config/mail.php file for storing details used in mail sending.
                            This file contains settings like MAIL_DRIVER, MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, etc. In order to
                            successfully send an email, we need to provide these information.</p>
                        <p>To add these required information, we need not edit this config/mail.php file, rather we
                            would supply these details accordingly in the .env file.
                            Thus, open your .env file which is located in your root directory of our application and
                            checkout for this settings:
                        </p>


                        <pre><code class="html">
                            MAIL_DRIVER=smtp
                            MAIL_HOST=mailtrap.io
                            MAIL_PORT=2525
                            MAIL_USERNAME=null
                            MAIL_PASSWORD=null
                            MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
                        </code></pre>
                    </section>

                    <p>In the above settings , we configured MAIL_DRIVER as smtp, MAIL_HOST for Gmail as
                        smtp.googlemail.com, MAIL_ PORT for Gmail as 465 and MAIL_ENCRYPTION method as ssl.
                        The MAIL_USERNAME and PASSWORD should be replaced with your Gmail Email address and Password
                        respectively.
                        Since we are using Gmail SMTP, we need to change some security settings on our Google account,
                        to give access to less secured applications.</p>
